        <p><strong style="color: #880023;">The Southeast Regional Coalition for University-Assisted Community Schools (SRCUACS)</strong>
            was awarded as the sixth regional training center for university-assisted community schools (UACS) by the
            Netter Center for Community Partnerships at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>SRCUACS will serve the critically important role of consolidating colleges and 
            universities within the state and across the region to enhance practice and advance policy
            change for the expansion and sustainability of community schools. SRCUACS will act as a 
            convener and central hub organized around six elements: Coalition Building, Storytelling,
            Connecting, Pipeline Development, Policy Change, and Research.</p>

                <h2>Coalition Building</h2>
                <p>SRCUACS is a three-institution collaboration between East Carolina University, Duke University,
                    and North Carolina Central University. North Carolina and the Southeastern United States is home
                    to a robust and diverse higher education ecosystem. By leveraging collective assets, SRCUACS
                    envisions an opportunity to learn across differences while also creating context-specific
                    professional learning communities. Join our network calls to broaden and deepen our coalition!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Storytelling</h2>
                <p>SRCUACS draws inspiration from UACS Regional Training Centers’ peer-reviewed publications
                    and related public-facing initiatives including UPenn’s <i>Universities and Community Schools
                    Journal</i>, UCLA’s <i>Community Schooling Journal</i>, and IUPUI’s <i>ENGAGE! Journal</i>.<br><br> 
                    SRCUACS expects to advance the work of community schools and their university partners
                    by providing dynamic vehicles for practitioner storytelling. Stay tuned for our online
                    publication in Fall 2024!</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Connecting</h2>
                <p>SRCUACS engages in asset mapping of the material, human, and organizational resources
                    that the partner institutions have available to offer local community schools. Close examination
                    of these assets will help the collaborative understand where duplication exists across the state
                    and region and identify spaces for innovation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Pipeline Development</h2>
                <p>SRCUACS will develop and operationalize a transformative educational preparation pipeline to
                    effectively recruit, prepare, and sustain community school practitioners. SRCUACS will develop
                    organizing frameworks for sharing curriculum and pedagogical strategies, including research- and
                    practice-based standards that guide regional and state educational preparation programs to prepare
                    racially diverse, historically literate teachers for service in locally situated university-assisted
                    community schools.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Policy Change</h2>
                <p>Policy change and ongoing support from policymakers will be essential to 
                    realizing the potential for the UACS model in North Carolina and the region. SRCUACS will leverage its work to support
                    policy changes that result in an increased number of community schools, more effective implementation of the UACS model,
                    and enhanced professional preparation programs that produce individuals with the capacity to contribute to the UACS model.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Community-based action research plays an essential role in building relationships between public-school
                    communities, higher education institutions, and other partners. Action research is a powerful tool that
                    can support the work of community school and UACS coalitions by generating data-driven insights into
                    the effectiveness of the strategy and identifying areas for improvement.
