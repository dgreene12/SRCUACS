</div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>This is a long introductory paragraph about us. Here we describe our organization, mission and vision.</p>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Coalition Building</h2>
                <p>SRCUACS is a three-institution collaboration between East Carolina
                    University, Duke University, and North Carolina Central University. Coalition building is the starting
                    point and is foundational to this proposal. Each institution possesses unique and strategic assets necessary
                    for broadening and deepening relationships with the diverse higher education ecosystem across North
                    Carolina and the Southeast region. By leveraging assets and respective relationships, SRCUACS
                    envisions an opportunity to learn across differences while also creating context-specific professional
                    learning communities.</p>
                <p>The goal is to build a three-institution coalition drawing from the strength of our respective institutions,
                    namely HBCUs, rural, and urban institutions. Training and technical assistance will be provided for
                    regional institutions interested in connecting the core mission of their colleges and universities to the six
                    pillars: Coalition Building, Storytelling, Connecting, Pipeline Development, Policy Change, and
                    Research. The SRCUACS will organize statewide and regional UACS leaders through monthly virtual
                    network calls, quarterly site visits, annual symposium gatherings, and an up-to-date web presence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Storytelling</h2>
                <p>Our SRCUACS collaborative draws inspiration from UACS Regional Training
                    Centers’ peer-reviewed publications and related public-facing initiatives including the Netter Center at
                    UPenn’s Universities and Community Schools Journal, the UCLA Center for Community Schooling
                    Journal, and IUPUI’s Community School’s Forward initiative. As a regional training center, SRCUACS
                    expects to advance the work of community schools and their university partners by providing dynamic
                    vehicles for practitioner storytelling about community schools. From drawing on experiences that range
                    from getting clarity and buy-in on community school pillars, to organizing communities and schools to
                    identify assets and needs, to the hard work of transforming school practices, each community school has
                    its story to tell. Centering practitioner voices and perspectives lifts up community, educator, and caregiver
                    stories and allows others considering adopting a community school model the opportunity to learn from
                    those immersed in values and practices of community schools.</p>
                <p>Our team is poised to facilitate story-sharing in diverse methods across several publication formats and
                    via diverse platforms. Leveraging a range of presentation methods creates opportunities for SRCUACS
                    collaborators and local practitioners to participate in action research, for example, to collect oral histories
                    of community assets that may then be disseminated through podcasts. We will use the network to gather
                    and share basic logistical information on building a community school; feature CS practitioner action
                    research projects; contribute to the academic scholarship on community schools; influence policy change
                    that advances community schools in the region; and survey and create resources to effect preparation
                    pipelines for community school educators and coordinators across our region.</p>
                <p>As a collective partnership, SRCUACS shares an intentional focus on community schools as a means of
                    advancing community-aware, context-specific, justice-oriented, and anti-racist education. The
                    collaboration of a public university attending to rural community school models; an HBCU focusing on
                    community schools as a tool for serving all students better; and a private university in close collaboration
                    with its urban public school district means we begin this center with a rich variety of stories to tell and we
                    anticipate being a national leader in sharing these conversations and stories across all platforms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Connecting</h2>
                <p>The sustainability of localized community school initiatives relies on creating and
                    supporting collective impact committees (CIC). In order to fully address the needs of a community, CICs
                    should be populated by a diverse group of representatives from the business and nonprofit sectors, as well
                    as local government and university leaders. In this way, community schools are intentional about building
                    connections. SRCUACS believes a regional community schools training center is uniquely positioned to
                    provide technical support for CICs in many domains, including mobilizing community resources across
                    different sectors and developing braided funding strategies.</p>
                <p>This current proposal brings to the forefront a commitment shared among partner institutions to explore
                    ways that universities might connect existing institutional strengths, initiatives, and resources with local
                    public schools in mutually beneficial ways. In its foundational stages, Duke and North Carolina Central’s
                    partnership envisioned a merging of institutional assets (e.g., big ideas such as research and service;
                    knowledge branches such as sciences, law/criminal justice, and teacher preparation; and auxiliary
                    supports including speech and language clinics, writing studios, etc.) to support Durham community
                    schools’ self-identified goals and values. The Durham partnership believes a conscious effort to leverage
                    university resources in direct response to the schools’ findings (e.g., via the Community Schools
                    Listening Project) would position Duke and NCCU to be better partners not only for community schools
                    being piloted in the district, but for the school district as a whole. Similarly, ECU’s involvement in this
                    work grew out of its commitment to schools and communities in the Eastern NC region and it’s
                    recognition of the role of universities as “connectors” (Morse, 2004; Johnson, Thompson, & Naugle,
                    2009) with the capacity and responsibility to link salient assets to identified needs.</p>
                <p>SRCUACS intends to engage in asset mapping of the material, human, and organizational resources that
                    the partner institutions have available to offer local community schools. Close examination of these assets
                    will help the collaborative understand where duplication exists across the state and region and identify
                    spaces for innovation. Data collected from this mapping project will result in a digital database of relevant
                    resources found at partnering institutions, which can then be used to match local community schools'
                    identified needs and serve as a starting point for collaborative programming. SRCUACS would create a
                    home for this database as well as a mechanism by which university faculty and staff can continuously
                    define and refine formalized collaborations with public school partners.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Pipeline Development</h2>
                <p>SRCUACS will develop and operationalize a transformative educational
                    preparation pipeline to effectively recruit, prepare, and sustain Community School Practitioners (CSPs).
                    SRCUACS will utilize existing partnerships with ~50 local education agencies (LEAs), including formal
                    networks such as the Latham Clinical Schools Network, to develop a teacher residency model for state
                    and regional educational preparation programs. Within the residency model for CSPs, teacher residents
                    will have robust professional learning experiences in existing community schools and will be prepared
                    onsite in a(n) university-assisted community school(s) with clinically aligned coursework.</p>
                <p>North Carolina has significant shortages in educational professionals across licensure areas. Our partner
                    LEAs need (a) highly qualified teachers who meet the requirements for full state licensure, (b) structures
                    and supports that sustain a new teacher pipeline, and (c) structures and support for teacher retention. The
                    need for expanding the pipeline and producing more education professions creates an opportunity for
                    equipping those professionals with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to contribute to the UACS
                    model. Teacher residency programs are an effective, comprehensive model for educator preparation.
                    Residency programs have been shown to expand recruitment of candidates of color to the profession and
                    improve district goals around teacher diversity, impact, and innovation. Residencies also provide
                    opportunities for experienced teachers to act as mentors, while developing highly effective new teachers
                    who are able to impact student achievement and community engagement from the moment they become
                    the teacher of record.</p>
                <p>SRCUACS will develop organizing frameworks for curriculum and pedagogical strategies, including
                    research- and practice-based standards that guide regional and state educational preparation programs to
                    prepare racially diverse, historically literate teachers for service in locally situated university-assisted
                    community schools. The development of a transformational, equity-focused CSP educator pipeline will
                    positively influence leadership practices and community engagement. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure
                    communities feel seen, heard, and supported by local public schools in North Carolina. As we expand
                    with the addition of partners throughout the Southeast region, we will support those partners in achieving
                    the same goal in their respective states.</p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h2>Policy Change</h2>
                <p>SRCUACS will leverage its work to support policy changes that result in an
                    increased number of community schools, more effective implementation of the UACS model, and
                    enhanced professional preparation programs that produce individuals with the capacity to contribute to the
                    UACS model. Policy change and ongoing support from policymakers will be essential to realizing the
                    potential for the UACS model in North Carolina and the region. Engaging policymakers to educate them
                    about the model and demonstrate its impact in achieving common objectives will be key, and elements of
                    the proposed Center directly address that work.</p>
                <p>SRCUACS will be well positioned to engage state policymakers owing to several key elements of the
                    proposed work—specifically, diversity in the initial partner sites (e.g., sites in both urban and rural
                    settings); the statewide network that facilitates interaction and shared learning among sites: the research
                    agenda for the empirical work (focuses on key elements of the UACS model but is appreciative of the
                    contextual characteristics of individual communities) and related communication plan for disseminating
                    results (focuses on varied products and delivery models for varied audiences); and the larger networks
                    with which SRCUACS is connected (increasing exposure and foster legitimacy with policymakers).
                    Identifying allies in state government and communicating with policymakers about what UACS sites are
                    doing, the results they are achieving, and how policy and policymakers can contribute will be a central
                    and ongoing part of our work.</p>
                <p>The statewide SRCUACS network with a central hub will facilitate communication and shared learning
                    among community school and UACS sites. This is crucial to developing understandings of how a shared
                    model can be effectively implemented in different settings.</p>

                <p>In 2018, Durham Public Schools (DPS) and the Durham Public Schools Foundation
                    partnered to pilot four community schools as a part of the Bull City Community Schools Partnership.
                    During this time, faculty and staff at Duke and North Carolina Central University developed the Durham
                    University-Assisted Community Schools Research Collective (DUACSRC), an interdisciplinary research
                    team tasked with exploring how these two universities could leverage resources necessary to address the
                    needs of local public schools through the UACS strategy. The DUACSRC is supported by Duke’s Bass
                    Connections and Data + programs.</p>
                <p>The DUACSRC operates through a year-long vertical integration model, engaging undergraduate
                    students, graduate students, faculty, staff, and community partners in action-research methods. The overall
                    research experience is rooted in interpretive social science methodologies that help to identify and
                    investigate needs identified by regional community schools. Their work is also informed through annual
                    site visits to UACS sites across the US which provides undergraduate researchers and faculty/staff leaders
                    insight into the ongoing work of CS and UACS. Each year, the DUACSRC consolidates their findings
                    and presents resources at the Bass Connections and Data+ showcase. A model for action-research such as
                    the one described promotes student-led advocacy and community participation through facilitating an
                    empowering research infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Community-based action research is a powerful tool that can support the work of these coalitions by
                    generating data-driven insights into the effectiveness of the UACS strategy and identifying areas for
                    improvement. Additionally, community-based action research plays an essential role in building
                    relationships between communities, universities, and other partners. The vertical integration model offers
                    an important infrastructure for engaging both undergraduate and graduate students, allowing them to
                    utilize expertise from their programs of study. It will also allow for the development of practitioners who
                    are skilled and empowered to work with their communities; expanding capacity for engaged action
                    researchers in the field focusing on informing ongoing UACS work.</p>
                <p>While only recently launched, the ECU partnership with Elizabeth City-Pasquotank Schools is utilizing
                    community-based action research with approaches that closely parallel the DUACSRC work to generate
                    insights about the UACS strategy in Elizabeth City and–more specifically–about the nuances of
                    implementing UACS in a rural setting.</p>
                <p>The SRCUACS will serve to better guide and connect interdisciplinary UACS teams interested in
                    launching community-based action research projects grounded in CS inquiry and strategy.</p>
